Merging: git merge <branch_name>: Combine changes from one branch into another.
Pulling: git pull origin <branch_name>: Fetch and merge changes from a remote repository.
Pushing: git push origin <branch_name>: Send changes to a remote repository.
Adding Remote: git remote add origin <repository_url>: Link a local repository to a remote repository.

####Git Log and Git Checkout

git log is used to display the commit history in a Git repository. It provides information such as commit hash, author, date, and commit message.
Additional options allow you to customize the output, show a concise log, limit the number of displayed commits, and visualize the commit history graphically.

Examples:
git log
git log --oneline
git log -n 5
git log --graph --oneline --all
git checkout is a versatile command used to switch branches, restore files, and navigate through commit history. It can be used to:

Switch to a different branch.
Create and switch to a new branch.
Discard changes in a specific file.
Switch to a specific commit.
Create and switch to a new branch at a specific commit.
Undo the last commit (with caution).
Examples:

git checkout <branch_name>
git checkout -b <new_branch_name>
git checkout -- <file_name>
git checkout <commit_hash>
git checkout -b <new_branch_name> <commit_hash>
git checkout HEAD^
